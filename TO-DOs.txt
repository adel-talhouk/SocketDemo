Networking TO-DOs:

MINIMUM:
. Make it clear what you send vs what you received (fix "You: ")
. Input IP address so different machines can communicate together.


EXTRA CREDIT:
. A "<user> is typing..." message that displays when someone else in the chatroom is typing a message.
. Connect to multiple peers at once and send and receive messages from/to each
. Ability to leave/join other chatrooms without exiting the program


PROBLEMS:
. The person that exits will get the message that the other person exited.
. The person that got ghosted (meaning the other exited) will NOT have their program end WITHOUT std::terminate. THIS HOWEVER GIVES AN EXCEPTION, WHICH WILL END THE PROGRAM AFTER HITTING RETRY. NOT A GOOD WAY THOUGH, NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE!!!
. If I enter a name on client first then server, server bugs out and doesn't update the text interface and cannot send messages.

QUESTIONS:
. Is it required we connect from different machines, or can it be on the same one for the submission?
