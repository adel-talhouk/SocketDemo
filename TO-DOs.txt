Networking TO-DOs:

MINIMUM:
. Make it clear what you send vs what you received (fix "You: ")


EXTRA CREDIT:
. Connect to multiple peers at once and send and receive messages from/to each
. A "<user> is typing..." message that displays when someone else in the chatroom is typing a message.
. Ability to leave/join other chatrooms without exiting the program


NOTES:
. If I enter a name on client first then server, server bugs out and doesn't update the text interface and cannot send messages.
. Commented out error check in TCPSocket::Receive().
. The person that exits will get the message that the other person exited.
. The person that got ghosted (meaning the other exited) will NOT have their program end.

QUESTIONS:
. //Client socket, connected to server address, is now listening on it - WHY DO WE NOT NEED THIS?
  //if (clientSocket->Listen() != NO_ERROR)
  //{
  //	  SocketUtil::ReportError("Listening on listening socket");
  //	  ExitProcess(1);
  //}
