Networking TO-DOs:

. Make sure that connections are gracefully closed on each side -- to do this, check if Receive() returned 0. That means the connection was closed. Display a message when connections are closed, even if they were forcefully closed (i.e., if Receive() returns an int < 0).
. Make it clear what you send vs what you received (fix "You: ")


EXTRA CREDIT:
. Connect to multiple peers at once and send and receive messages from/to each
. A "<user> is typing..." message that displays when someone else in the chatroom is typing a message.
. Ability to leave/join other chatrooms without exiting the program
